## Projects
All data in [Trubrics](https://trubrics.streamlit.app/) is organised into Projects. It is up to you how you group your projects, but we suggest that you create different projects per AI use case. All user prompts are stored directly within the project. They can be filtered by model config, prompt template, tags, etc. Upon account creation, a `default` project is created.

## Feedback components
Within a project, users may also create feedback components to organise user feedback. Each component collects a unique [type](./user_feedback.md#types-of-feedback) of feedback, enabling you to collect several types of feedback for the same AI use case.

### Create a feedback component
At the top of the `Feedback` page in [Trubrics](https://trubrics.streamlit.app/), you can create a feedback component. To help you determine what type of feedback to use, there is a generated code snippet of the component to include into your AI application, and a visual preview of the UI component. A `default` component is created in the `default` project upon account creation, allowing users to to directly start saving üëç / üëé user feedback.
