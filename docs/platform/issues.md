# ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues

`Issues` allow AI teams to group user comments and manage all feedback. Similar to how GitHub uses issues to track all features requests / bugs for a code repository, Trubrics applies the same philosophy to AI models.

## Create an issue
Creating an issue requires a user to select at least one comment in the `Comments` tab of ü™Ñ Insights, and to provide a title and description.

## Open / close an issue
To open or close an issue, a single issue must be selected. For more context on the issue, users can search for the linked comment IDs in the `Comments` tab.
