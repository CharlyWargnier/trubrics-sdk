# Gather feedback from business users
The trubrics FeedbackCollector enables business users to provide feedback on your models behaviour. The feedback can then be translated into validation points. To achieve this, the trubrics FeedbackCollector integrates with Streamlit to help build python applications on top of your model for the business user to interact with.

A full example can be seen in `trubrics/example/feedback_app_titanic.py`, and run with `trubrics example-titanic-app`.
